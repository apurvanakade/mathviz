   * Random-walk Metropolis: from `x`, propose `y = x + step`, with the step
   * drawn from a symmetric distribution, and accept with probability
   * `min(1, pi(y) / pi(x))`. Symmetric proposals need no Hastings
   * correction. Two step distributions:
   *
   * - `"uniform"`: each coordinate `U(-scale, scale)`, i.e. uniform on the
   *   box of side `2 * scale` centered at `x`;
   * - `"gaussian"`: each coordinate `N(0, scale^2)`.
   *
   * The target is given as a log density up to an additive constant, so a
   * uniform target on a region is `0` inside and `-Infinity` outside, and
   * proposals outside are always rejected -- the "random walk in a region"
   * sampler.
   *
   * Randomness is consumed in a fixed order -- the proposal's coordinates,
   * then one uniform for the accept test, every step -- so a seeded `rng`
   * reproduces the same chain, and two runs that differ only in `scale`
   * share their underlying draws.
   *
   * @param {Object} args
   * @param {(x: number[]) => number} args.logDensity - Log target density,
   *   up to a constant.
   * @param {number[]} args.start - Initial state; its length sets the
   *   dimension. A one-dimensional chain uses `[x0]`.
   * @param {number} args.n - Number of states returned, including `start`;
   *   a positive integer, else a `RangeError` is thrown.
   * @param {number} args.scale - Proposal half-width (`"uniform"`) or
   *   standard deviation (`"gaussian"`).
   * @param {() => number} args.rng - Uniform `[0, 1)` generator, e.g.
   *   `VM.sampling.seededRandom(seed)`.
   * @param {string} [args.proposal="uniform"] - `"uniform"` or `"gaussian"`.
   * @returns {{samples: number[][], proposals: (number[]|null)[],
   *   accepted: boolean[], acceptedCount: number}} Arrays of length `n`,
   *   indexed by step: `samples[t]` is the state after step `t`,
   *   `proposals[t]` the point proposed at step `t` and `accepted[t]`
   *   whether it was taken. Index `0` is the start: `proposals[0]` is
   *   `null` and `accepted[0]` is `true`. `acceptedCount` counts steps
   *   `1..n-1` only.
